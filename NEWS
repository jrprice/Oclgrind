This release updates to LLVM 3.6, which improves the OpenCL C compiler
and provides some additional performance enhancements. See README for
revised instructions on how to build Oclgrind from source.

- Fixed race conditions in atomic operations
- Interactive debugger breaks on Ctrl+C
- Various other minor bug fixes


Oclgrind 15.2

several bugs impacting on usage and stability.

- Added detection for violations of read-only/write-only attributes
- Added --build-options argument to append additional compiler flags
- Added hostMemoryLoad and hostMemoryStore callbacks
- Added workGroupBegin and workItemBegin callbacks
- Split atomic callbacks into separate load and store
- Multi-threaded simulation to improve performance
- Various other performance improvements
- Several general bug fixes and stability improvements


Oclgrind 14.12
==============
This release incorporates a new plugin system, to allow third-party
developers to build tools that utilise Oclgrind. More information can
be found on the Wiki:
https://github.com/jrprice/Oclgrind/wiki/Creating-Plugins

In addition, this release contains the following changes:
- Interactive debugger now has a command history
- Detection for unaligned memory accesses
- Limit the number of error messages printed to avoid flooding output
- Various other bug fixes and improvements


Oclgrind 14.5
=============
Initial release (beta).

Implements a SPIR 1.2 interpreter which can be targeted either via an
OpenCL 1.2 runtime API implementation or using a standalone kernel
interface.

Provides the following utilities:
- Memory access error detection
- Work-group divergence detection (barriers, async-copies)
- Data-race detection (--data-races)
- Simple interactive debugger (--interactive)
- Instruction histograms (--inst-counts)
- OpenCL runtime API error reporting (--check-api)
